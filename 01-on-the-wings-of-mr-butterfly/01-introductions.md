# On the wings of Mr. Butterfly

## Introductions

One day, the Twins were journeying in the valley, and came across a strange
glade: while the forest around it was all green, full of birds and wildlife, the
glade felt... too calm. While the surroundings were filled by the songs of
birds, and the rustle of tree leaves, the glade was all but silent. They could
hear a faint buzzing sound coming from the birdbath - a hollow stone, really -,
but otherwise it was just silence. While such silence could have been scary,
they felt tranquility: the kind we feel before we figure out a great idea, and
get enlightened. This was the most fascinating part of the glade: it did not
only look stunning in its simplicity, it soothed their minds too.

"*Curious.*" - he said, and they sneaked closer to the birdbath, watching every
step, to not make any noise. Within the birdbath, they saw no birds having fun,
but a butterfly basking in the sun. "*Oh, hello there, children!*" - it said,
and they looked at it with eyes wide open. A talking butterfly! They have seen
strange things during their many adventures, but a talking butterfly was
something new. "*Don't be afraid, I don't bite.*" - the little creature
continued. They stepped closer and saw that the butterfly was no ordinary
creature, nor was it basking in the sun after all! It held a tiny magnifying
glass in its tiny hands, outsized goggles over its eyes, and it was soldering
something by collecting the rays of the sun with the magnifier. "*Are you two
just going to stand there, or will you help me fix this thing?*" - it asked,
seeing the dumbfounded look on the Twins' faces.
