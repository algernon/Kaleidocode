# On the wings of Mr. Butterfly

## Introductions

One day, the Twins were journeying in the valley, and came across a strange
glade: while the forest around it was all green, full of birds and wildlife, the
glade felt... too calm. They could hear a faint buzzing sound coming from the
birdbath - a hollow stone, really -, but otherwise it was just silence. While
such silence could have been scary, they felt tranquility: the kind we feel
before we figure out a great idea, and get enlightened. This was the most
fascinating part of the glade: it did not only look stunning in its simplicity,
it soothed their minds too.

"*Curious.*" - he said, and they sneaked closer to the birdbath, watching every
step, to not make any noise. Within the birdbath, they saw no birds having fun,
but a butterfly basking in the sun. "*Oh, hello there, children!*" - it said,
and they looked at it with eyes wide open. A talking butterfly! They have seen
strange things during their many adventures, but a talking butterfly was
something new. "*Don't be afraid, I don't bite.*" -t the little creature
continued.
