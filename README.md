Once upon a time there lived a young girl and her twin brother, past the glass mountain, in a land of green fields, high hills, lush valleys and lots of gadgets. Of all the gadgets their favourites were those they could change, to make them do what they wanted to do. The possibilities were endless! Curious as they were, everything they came across, they examined it, studied it, and saw if they can build something similar, or even better - something bigger, and even more extraordinary. During their many travels they met a wise creature, Mr. Butterfly. The journal in your hands is a chronicle of their feats, a sticker book of their achievements.
