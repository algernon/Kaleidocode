# Various notes, half-finished ideas

This section here is a random collection of ideas, half-finished notes and
similar, which I will eventually integrate into the storyline. Or perhaps not,
and they serve me as a reminder about the characters.

## Characters

### Mr. Butterfly

Wise, good with hardware, and the garden. Friends with Mr. Mouse. Likes
teaching, especially about gadgets.

### Mr. Mouse

Talks a lot at times, terrible with hardware, but quite good at programming
them. Promises never to build things, but always does, and it is always a
disaster. A funny disaster, but still. Loves his wife, Daisy, and their "kids",
the robo-turtles.

### Daisy

Daisy, the "tiger-mother". Loves his children (Mr. Mouse is like a big child to
her, too), her garden. Worries a lot, talks even more than Mr. Mouse. Like
hearing about gadgets, but prefers living things.

### Turtles

Kids of Mr. Mouse & Daisy. Three of them, two girls, one boy: Knot, Danny, and
Mansi. They are robotically augmented. Knot's the biggest, Danny always wants to
play, Mansi sleeps the most.
